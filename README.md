# MiniScript Dart
An exact port of the MiniScript C# interpreter for Dart.

# Installation
## CLI Installation
Run `dart pub global activate miniscript` on your terminal.

## Library Installation
Run `dart pub add miniscript` on your workspace terminal.

# Limitations
Due to how Dart's typings work, we are unable to make a `floatValue` function and enforce the use of single floating point type.
